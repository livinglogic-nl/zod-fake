## Intersections

Intersections are useful for creating "logical AND" types. This is useful for intersecting two object types.

```ts
const Person = z.object({
  name: z.string(),
});

const Employee = z.object({
  role: z.string(),
});

const EmployedPerson = z.intersection(Person, Employee);

// equivalent to:
const EmployedPerson = Person.and(Employee);
```

Though in many cases, it is recommended to use `A.merge(B)` to merge two objects. The `.merge` method returns a new `ZodObject` instance, whereas `A.and(B)` returns a less useful `ZodIntersection` instance that lacks common object methods like `pick` and `omit`.

```ts
const a = z.union([z.number(), z.string()]);
const b = z.union([z.number(), z.boolean()]);
const c = z.intersection(a, b);

type c = z.infer<typeof c>; // => number
```

<!-- Intersections in Zod are not smart. Whatever data you pass into `.parse()` gets passed into the two intersected schemas. Because Zod object schemas don't allow any unknown keys by default, there are some unintuitive behavior surrounding intersections of object schemas. -->

<!--

``` ts
const A = z.object({
  a: z.string(),
});

const B = z.object({
  b: z.string(),
});

const AB = z.intersection(A, B);

type Teacher = z.infer<typeof Teacher>;
// { id:string; name:string };
```  -->
